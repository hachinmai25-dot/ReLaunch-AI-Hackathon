# Use Case Documentation – ReLaunchAI

## Overview

ReLaunchAI is a B2B AI-powered platform created to support women who want to return to technology careers after taking a career break. Many women temporarily step away from work due to family responsibilities, caregiving, or personal reasons. When they decide to restart their careers, they often feel uncertain about current industry requirements, modern tools, and evolving technologies.

At the same time, organizations are facing shortages in technology talent across areas such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data analytics, DevOps, and software development. Despite this demand, there is no structured and scalable system that helps enterprises reintegrate experienced women professionals back into tech roles.

ReLaunchAI addresses this gap by combining AI-driven assessment with guided upskilling support.

## Problem Statement

Women returning to tech roles commonly experience:

- Difficulty understanding updated skill expectations  
- Lack of clarity about industry trends  
- Reduced professional confidence  
- Limited structured return-to-work support  

From an enterprise perspective, companies face challenges in:

- Identifying return-ready candidates objectively  
- Measuring skill gaps efficiently  
- Building scalable diversity hiring initiatives  

This disconnect leads to underutilized talent and missed hiring opportunities.

## Proposed Solution

ReLaunchAI provides enterprises with a structured platform to assess, guide, and monitor women returning to tech careers.

The platform includes three main components:

1. AI-Based Skill Assessment  
Candidates upload their resumes, and the system evaluates existing technical skills against current job market requirements. The platform generates a readiness score and highlights specific skill gaps.

2. Personalized Upskilling Path  
Based on assessment results, users receive tailored learning recommendations aligned with targeted tech roles such as Cloud Engineer, Data Analyst, AI/ML Engineer, or DevOps Specialist.

3. Enterprise Analytics Dashboard  
HR teams can track candidate progress, analyze readiness levels, and gain insights into diversity hiring pipelines through a centralized dashboard.

## Business Value

ReLaunchAI offers tangible value to enterprises by:

- Expanding access to experienced talent  
- Supporting diversity and inclusion goals  
- Reducing hiring and onboarding costs  
- Creating data-driven workforce reintegration programs  
## Conclusion

ReLaunchAI combines social impact with enterprise scalability. Built on cloud-native architecture and AI-driven skill assessment, the platform leverages AWS services to ensure secure resume processing, scalable analytics, and real-time readiness scoring. By integrating intelligent assessment with enterprise workforce insights, ReLaunchAI creates a structured, data-driven pathway for women to confidently return to tech roles while enabling organizations to strengthen diversity initiatives and address evolving technology talent demands.
