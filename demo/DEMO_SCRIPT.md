# ReLaunchAI – 2 Minute Hackathon Demo Script

## Opening (20–25 seconds)

Good morning respected judges.

We are presenting ReLaunchAI, a B2B AI-powered workforce re-entry platform designed to help enterprises reintegrate women returning to technology careers after career breaks.

Today, thousands of skilled women leave tech roles due to caregiving or personal responsibilities. When they try to return, they struggle with updated skill requirements and confidence gaps.

At the same time, companies face major talent shortages in AI, cloud, DevOps, and data roles.

ReLaunchAI bridges this gap.
